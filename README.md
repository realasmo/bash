## Welcome to Owl Bash Scripts, selected quality tools!




  
   

###### I decided to share selected scripts that I think are worth it, for various reasons, let it be lack of alternatives or different approach than similar existing tools.

###### If you found something here useful and would like to have some features added, maybe you managed to find a bug that needs fixing, or you would like to contribute to some code, let me know and we can talk details.
